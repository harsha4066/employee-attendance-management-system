# üïí Employee Attendance Monitoring System (EAMS)

This is a Python-based system to track employee attendance using biometric login and location verification, built for construction firms with distributed sites. It was developed as part of the final year Information Systems project.

## üìå Problem Statement
Manual attendance tracking at construction sites leads to:
- Time theft (buddy punching)
- Human errors in payroll
- Compliance risks
- No real-time workforce visibility

---

## ‚úÖ Solution
The **Employee Attendance Monitoring System (EAMS)**:
- Replaces manual logs with biometric + GPS login
- Automates clock-in/out with time calculations
- Provides real-time reports and notifications
- Enables role-based access (Admin / Employee)

## üìê System Design

### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
- `users`: Common login table (employee/admin)
- `employees` / `admins`: Linked by `user_id`
- `attendance`: Tracks check-in/check-out and hours worked

### Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)
- Level 0 and Context DFD included in report

### Use Case Highlights
- UC-01: Clock-in/Clock-out with GPS
- UC-02: Admin dashboard with export
- UC-03: Employee profile management

## üìä Reports & Analytics
- Daily/Monthly reports
- Absentee trend analysis
- Auto-alerts for late logins, early exits
- Export to CSV
